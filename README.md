# stock_price_prediction
The goal is to have a deep learning model to predict stock prices using tensorflow an other libraries. Please find the dataset attached [here](http://files.statworx.com/sp500.zip). The csv contains 41266 minutes of data from April to August 2017 on 500 stocks as well as the total S&P 500 index prices.

**Just a small visualization done**
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot('NASDAQ.AAL')
plt.show()
```
Using the above syntax will visualize the data

**Task to do**
- [x] Evaluate Dimenality of dataset
- [x] Create and arrange datasets into training and testing data
- [x] use a scaling algorithm
- [x] create the neural network
- [x] create a cost function and optimize it
- [x] Setup interactive plot
- [x] Some more training
- [x] Print final MSE after Training

**Output:**
